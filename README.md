# Polymer
A simple, decentralized and unsafe implementation of a blockchain.
------
Polymer is a decentralized blockchain with the simplest code we could manage to write. It's not meant to be used as a component in bigger projects (even though you may do so, if you want to), but as a way to show people how simple can blockchains be and inspire people to code their own.
